More advanced topics
====================

If you have read and understood all basic topics covered in
{% for res in site.content.walk_resources_grouped_by_basic() %}
[{{ res.slug|capitalize|replace("-"," ") }}]({{ res.full_url }}), 
{% endfor %}
then you are ready for some more advanced features. They are explained in
the same way as the basic part, building on the knowledge of the previous,
so it is recommended that you follow them in the listed order.

{% for res in resource.node.walk_resources_sorted_by_index() %}
{{ loop.index }}. [{{ res.slug|capitalize|replace("-"," ") }}]({{ res.full_url }}) {% if res.name == "overview.html" %}*(this file)*{% endif %} 
{% endfor %}
