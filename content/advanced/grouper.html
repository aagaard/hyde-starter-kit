Grouping
========

Content is very often grouped by theme, size, location or any other
conceivable measure. Groups can be traversed in a few ways in Hyde, and 
[sorted](sorter.html) at the same time. Here are two common ways:

Walking all groups and subgroups
--------------------------------

{# Resources are sorted by defining a sorter in the configuration file. #}

{% for grp, res_walker in site.content.walk_level_groups() %}
*{{ grp.description }}*

{% for res in res_walker %}
* {{ res.name }}
{% endfor %}

{% endfor %}

Listing only the specific (sub)group
------------------------------------

{% for res in site.content.walk_resources_grouped_by_advanced() %}
* {{ res.name }}
{% endfor %}

{# You can also call the top level group "level" to get all resources that
   are in the group. Or you can list all resources of the same group in the
   current node with "resource.node.walk_resource_grouped_by_advanced()".
#}
